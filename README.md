# basic-express-server
## Documntatin :
- the main file here is index.js where I can start & run my code from it.
- in the server.js I have all the routes & I also use the middlewares there.
- in the middlewares folder I write each middleware in separate file and import them to server.js.
- in the error handler I coverd the possible errors with 404 & 500 status.
- in the testing I coverd every possible scenario.
